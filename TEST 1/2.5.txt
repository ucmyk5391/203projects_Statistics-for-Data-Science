If the product of their marginal PDFs = joint PDF, it means they are independent.

Marginal PDFs:
fX(x) = 3/5 * (2 - x^2)
fY(y) = y/2

If we multiply fX(x) and fY(y) = (3/5 * (2 - x^2)) * (y/2)
                               = 3/10 * (2 - x^2) * y = joint PDF we found earlier.

Therefore, they are independent.
