Given the joint pdf, fX,Y(x,y) = c * (2 - x^2) * y where x is in the interval [0,1] and y is in the interval [0,2].

The second property can be used to find the value of c. To do this, integrate the pdf over the given intervals of x and y.

To start, perform the integral with respect to y:
∫(0 to 1) ∫(0 to 2) c * (2 - x^2) = y dy dx = 1

∫(0 to 2) = 1/2 * y2 |(0,2) = 2

If we now integrate it respect to x:

∫(0 to 1) c * (2 - x^2) * 2dx = 1
2c * ∫(0 to 1) (2 - x^2) dx = 1
2c * (2x - x^3/3) |(0,1) = 1
2c * (2 - 1/3) = 1
2c * 5/3 = 1

So c = 3/10
