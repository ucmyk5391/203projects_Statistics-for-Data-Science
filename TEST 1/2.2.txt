In order to find the mode of Y, we need to find the value of y that maximizes the marginal PDF of Y.

The marginal PDF of Y = integrating the joint pdf over all possible values of x.

From 2.1 we know that the joint pdf is =
f(x,y) = 3/10 * (2 - x^2)y

So if we integrate over x in the interval [0,1],
fY(y) = ∫(0 to 1) f(x,y) dx
fY(y) = ∫(0 to 1) 3/10 * (2 - x^2)y dx
fY(y) = 3y/10 * ∫(0 to 1) (2 - x^2) dx

Now if we integrate it with respect to x:
fY(y) = 3y/10 * (2x - x^3/3)|(0, 1)
fY(y) = 3y/10 * (2 - 1/3)
fY(y) = 5y/10 = y/2

Since the marginal PDF is a linear function of y in the range of [0,2] and is increasing with y, it will be maximized at the upper bound of the range of Y which is 2.
