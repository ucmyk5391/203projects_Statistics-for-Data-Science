Derving from Bayes' rule, we know that (P(X|Y) * P(Y)) / P(Y) = (P(Y|X) * P(X)) / P(Y)
                                       P(X|Y) = (P(Y|X) * P(X)) / P(Y)

So, here if we apply it, (P(A | Y < 1) * P(A)) / P(Y < 1).

And question is if the piece has final length less than 1, what is the conditional probability that it came from machine A.

We know from the drawn graph earlier, A should be in range of (0,2) and B is (0,3).

(P(A | Y < 1) * P(A)) = 1/2 * 1/4 = 1/8

P(Y < 1) from A and B given,
For A = 1/2 * 1/4 = 1/8
For B = 1/3 * 3/4 = 1/4
Now if we add both A and B cases, we get 3/8

Therefore if we divide 1/8 and 3/8, we get 1/3
