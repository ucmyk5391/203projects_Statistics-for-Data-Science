The Law of Iterated Expectations: E[Y] = E[E[Y|X]]

1. E[Y|X] = X

2. Cov[X, Y] = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y]

3. Cov[X, Y] = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2

Using the Law of Iterated Expectations:
4. E[Y] = E[E[Y|X]] = E[X]

5. Cov[X, Y] = E[XY] - (E[X])^2

Since E[Y|X] = X, 
6. E[XY] = E[X]E[Y|X] = XE[X]

7. Cov[X, Y] = XE[X] - (E[X])^2

8. Cov[X, Y] = E[X] * (X - E[X])

9. V[X] = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2

When we look at the formula for Cov[X, Y] and compare it to V[X], we see they are the same. So, if E[Y|X] = X, then Cov[X, Y] is the same as V[X].
