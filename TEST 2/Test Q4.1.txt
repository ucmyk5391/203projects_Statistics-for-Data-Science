1. A = W|L

2. E[Aâˆ£W=w]=E[wL]

3. Because  W is given as a constant w in this conditional expectation, it's no longer a random variable. 

4. L is a random variable that is uniformly distributed over [0,2].

5. E[L] = (0 + 2)/2
E(L) = 1

6. Since W and L are independent:
E[wL] = w * E[L]

7. E[A|W = w] = w * 1 = w

8. Therefore, the conditional expectation of A given W is w.
