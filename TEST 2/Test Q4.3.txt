1. V[A] = E[A^2] - (E[A])^2

2. We know that A = W * L:
E[A] = E[W * L] = E[W] * E[L] = 1*1 = 1

meaning (E[A])^2 = 1^2 = 1

3. For E[A^2]:
E[W^2 * L^2] = E[W^2] * E[L^2]

4. And we know that E[L^2] = 4/3

5. So we just need to find E[W^2] now and knowing that its uniform distribution on [0,2],
E[W^2] = ∫0 to 2 * w^2 * 1/2 * dw
E[W^2] = 1/2 * ∫0 to 2 w^2 * dw
E[W^2] = 1/2 * [w^3/3]0 to 2
E[W^2] = 1/2 * 2^3/3
E[W^2] = 1/2 * 8/3
E[W^2] = 4/3

6. Substituting all our findings into our equation for E[A^2]:
E[A^2] = 4/3 * 4/3 = 16/9

7. V[A] = E[A^2] - (E[A])^2
V[A] = 16/9 - 1 = 7/9

8. Therfore V[A] = 7/9
