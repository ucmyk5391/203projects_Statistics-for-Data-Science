1. We need to find the expected value of E[W_i^2] first which is:
E[W_i^2] = ∫0 to λ * x^2 * 1/λ * dx
= 1/λ [x^3/3]0 to λ
= 1/λ * (λ^3/3 - 0)
= E[W_i^2] = λ^2/3

2. And now to find variance:
Var(W_i^2) = E[W_i^4] - (E[W_i^2])^2


Integrating E[W_i^4],
E[W_i^4] = ∫0 to λ x^4 * 1/λ * dx
= 1/λ * [x^5/5]0 to λ
= 1/λ * (λ^5/5)
E[W_i^4] = λ^4/5

So Var(W_i^2) = λ^4/5 - (λ^2/3)^2
= λ^4 * (4/45)

3. Convergence:
Variance of the average of the W_i^2 is:
Var(Y_n) = 1/n^2 * Σi=1 to n * Var(W_i^2)
= (n * λ^4 * (4/45)) / n^2
= 4λ^4 / 45n

4. By Chebyshev's inequality, as n goes to infinity, Var(Y_n) will appraoch to 0, meaning Y_n converges in probability to E[W_i^2] = λ^2/3

5. Therefore the probability limit of Y_n is:
lim n to infinity Y_n = λ^2/3
